                <ul>
                    <li>A business must take reasonable measures to ensure the destruction of records containing customers’ personal information when it decides to no longer maintain them. Reasonable measures render the personal information in the records unreadable or undecipherable (such as shredding or erasing the information)</li>
                    <li>If a data collector discloses personal information to a third party pursuant to a contract, the contract must require the third party to comply with the statute’s security requirements</li>
                    <li>A data collector that does not accept payment card transactions must not electronically transfer any personal information other than via a facsimile outside its secure system unless it is encrypted. Similarly, it may not move a storage device containing personal information beyond its logical or physical control or the control of its data storage contractor or other party unless it is encrypted</li>
                    <li>This staute doesn't define reasonable security procedures and practices. It is recommended to comply with the <a href="Massachusetts_Information_Security_Standard.html">Massachusetts Information Security Standard</a></li>
